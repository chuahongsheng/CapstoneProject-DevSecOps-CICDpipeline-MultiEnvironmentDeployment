# Project Description

## Objective

* Deploying a static website on multiple enviroments with Github Actions to AWS S3.
* Changes to website will be automated and deployed to Staging stage first and await reviewer approval on Github. Upon approval, will then be deployed to production stage.

---

## Application Structure

For the deployment workflow, we combined the deployment job into a single YML file.
Over here, we can use **strategy** to create a reuseable matrix job for deployment for best practices. This will also reduce the processing time by Github Actions

## Some of the challenges faced 
* Exporting the static files directly to AWS S3 bucket
* Setting up a isolated runtime enviroment on the unit testing for the website 

## Features that we hope to implement in the future
- Distributing the website on CloudFront

## Running the project
Over here, we will introduce on how to deploy on multiple enviroments with Github Actions. In this case study, we will have several enviroments, eg: **Development**, **Staging**, **Production**. 

We will be using the main yml file to automate the CICD pipeline. In the main workflow file, everytime when code is push to main branch, job will be triggered in the development stage. Development stage will consist of installing dependencies, unit testing, package scanning and upload artifacts for scanning.

Once development build is finished, reuseable maxtrix for deployment will deploy the job to Staging. 
Once Staging enviroment passes, you will see Deploy to Production job pending on the approval from reviewers.

Deployment yml file (CD pipeline) is used to automatically sync any changes to the static website into the multi enviroments hosted on AWS S3 buckets.
